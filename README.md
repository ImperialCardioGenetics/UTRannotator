# 5'UTR annotator
VEP Plugin to annotate high-impact five prime UTR variants either creating new upstream ORFs or disrupting existing upstream ORFs

Currently, it will annotate whether a small variation (1-5bp) including SNVs, indels and MNVs in 5'UTR would have any of the following molecular consequences:

 - uAUG-gained: creating a new start codon AUG
 - uAUG-lost: removing an existing start codon AUG
 - uSTOP-lost: removing the stop codon of an existing upstream ORF
 - uFrameShift: creating a frameshift mutation in an existing upstream ORF

# Caveats 
- only tested on SNVs, small indels (1-5bp) and MNV (1-5bp)
- only consider canonical start codon

# Requirements
- VEP (tested on release-99/202001 and release-100/202005)
- PERL (tested on version 5.26.2)

# Installation
To use the plugin with VEP, you would need to add the plugin module in Perl's library path. To do this, you could either: 

(1) copy all the files of this repository to the VEP default path `$HOME/.vep/Plugins` or

(2) copy the repository and add its path to environment variable `$PERL5LIB`. 

e.g. Add this line `export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/path/to/UTRannotator` to `~/.bash_profile`.

# Usage
The Plugin could be run with VEP using the following command (if using hg19 genome build): 

`vep -i test.vcf --database --hgvs --tab --port 3337 --minimal -plugin UTRannotator,/path/to/uORF_starts_ends_GRCh37_PUBLIC.txt -o test.output`. 

To be noticed, it's necessary to add option `--minimal` to transform the alleles into minimal representations if it hasn't been transformed beforehand. We have found that this option is necessary especially for variants represented with rs IDs from dbSNP. 


# Documentation on the output

The output annotation from the plugin includes 5 columns: 

For any 5'UTR variants, the plugin will first output the number of existing subtype uORFs in the 5'UTR

    Column 1 - existing_InFrame_oORFs: The number of existing inframe overlapping ORFs (inFrame_oORF) within the 5 prime UTR
    Column 3 - existing_OutOfFrame_oORFs: The number of existing out-of-frame overlapping ORFs (OutOfFrame_oORF) within the 5 prime UTR
    Column 2 - existing_uORFs: The number of existing uORFs with a stop codon within the 5 prime UTR

If this 5'UTR is uORF-perturbing, the plugin will output the consequence and detailed annotation of each consequence: 

	Column 4 - five_prime_UTR_variant_annotation: Output the annotation of a given 5 prime UTR variant
    Column 5 - five_prime_UTR_variant_consequence: Output the variant consequences of a given 5 prime UTR variant: uAUG_gained, uAUG_lost, uSTOP_lost, and uFrameshift

If a 5'UTR variant perturbs multiple uORFs, the output for each uORF will be concatenated with a vertical bar `|`;
